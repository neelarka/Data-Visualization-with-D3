# Data Journalism with JavaScript D3 and SVG
In this project I investigated the relationship between demographic information (from U.S. Census) and health risk (from C.D.C) by creating a data visulization with JavaScript and D3.I created a JavaScript file that housed the D3 script to produce a scatterplot to observe the correlation between poverty and the percentage of people who lacks healthcare in the United States. Each point on the scatterplot represents a state and when the user hovers over the point, a tooltip will appear with details on the percentage of proverty that state has and the percentage of people who lacks health insurance for a particular state.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
